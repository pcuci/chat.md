Couldn't find match. Here's the latest snippet from the file which might be relevant for you to consider:
```  if (filePath.startsWith('~')) {
    return filePath.replace(/^~/, process.env.HOME || '');
  }
  
  // If it's an absolute path, return as is
  if (path.isAbsolute(filePath)) {
    return filePath;
  }
  
  // Try to resolve relative to the document
  const documentDir = path.dirname(document.uri.fsPath);
  const resolvedPath = path.resolve(documentDir, filePath);
  
  return resolvedPath;
}

/**
 * Check if a file exists and is accessible

export function fileExists(filePath: string): boolean {
  try {
    fs.accessSync(filePath, fs.constants.R_OK);
    return true;

Retry immediately with same "percentage_to_change" using search replace blocks fixing above error.
