Warning: tree-sitter reported syntax errors, please re-read the file and fix if there are any errors.
Syntax errors:
Line 253, Column 1: Syntax error: unexpected ERROR in program
Note: Ignore if 'tagged template literals' are used, they may raise false positive errors in tree-sitter.

Here's relevant snippet from the file where the syntax errors occured:
```
            content: [{ type: 'text', value: content }] // Always text after inlining
        });
    } else {
         log(`Warning: Skipping unrecognized role block: "${role}"`);
    }
  } // End main loop


  return Object.freeze(messages);
}


/**
 * Parses user content to extract text and file references
 * (Ensure document is passed if resolving relative paths)
 */
function parseUserContent(text: string, document?: vscode.TextDocument): Content[] { // Added optional document
  const content: Content[] = [];

  // Original format: "Attached file at /path/to/file"
```
