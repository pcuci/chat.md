```
    }
  }
  
  /**
   * Start streaming response from LLM
   */
  private async startStreaming(): Promise<void> {
    // Try to acquire lock - if we can't, it means another streamer is running
    const acquired = await this. // Small timeout
    if (!acquired) {
      log('Another streamer is running, marking it for cancellation');
      if (this.currentStreamer) {
        this.currentStreamer.isActive = false;
      }
      // Wait for lock to be released by current streamer
      await this.lock.acquire();
    }

    try {
      // Cancel any existing streamer (should be done already, but just in case)
```
