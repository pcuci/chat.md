I'll initialize the project for a modern React Vite Tailwind Todo Manager app in the specified directory. 

```tool_call
<tool_call>
<tool_name>Initialize</tool_name>
<param name="type">first_call</param>
<param name="any_workspace_path">/tmp/app-react-vite-91xj1</param>
<param name="initial_files_to_read">[]</param>
<param name="task_id_to_resume">null</param>
<param name="mode_name">wcgw</param>
</tool_call>
```

# %% tool_execute
<tool_result>
[Tool Result](cmdassets/tool-result-20250416-174243-i1u4zy.txt)
</tool_result>

# %% assistant
The initialization is complete, and the project directory has been created. I'll now set up the basic structure for a React Vite Tailwind project. 

Let's proceed by creating the necessary files and installing the required packages. 

```tool_call
<BashCommand>
<action_json>
{
  "command": "npm create vite@latest . --template react"
}
</action_json>
</BashCommand>
```
